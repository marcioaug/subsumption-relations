Optimizing Mutation Testing by Discovering Dynamic Mutant Subsumption Relations
===============================================================================

Abstract—Mutation analysis is a popular but costly approach
to assess the quality of test suites. One recent promising direction
on reducing costs of mutation analysis is to identify redundant
mutations, i.e., mutations that are subsumed by some other mutations.
Previous works found out redundant mutants manually
through the truth table. Although the idea is promising, it can
only be applied for logical and relational operators. In this paper,
we propose an approach to discover redundancy in mutations
through dynamic subsumption relations among mutants. Past
work has demonstrated that finding out the true subsumption
relation among mutants in large blocks of code (like a class or a
function) is difficult (in some cases computationally infeasible),
mainly because of the context-information that needs to be taken
into account. This way, we reduced the scope and focused on
subsumption relations among mutations of an expression or
statement, named here as “mutation target.” By focusing on
targets and relying on automatic test generation tools, we defined
subsumption relations for dozens of mutation targets in which the
MuJava tool can apply mutations. We then implemented these
relations in a tool, named MuJava-M, that generates a reduced
set of mutants for each target, avoiding redundant mutants. We
evaluated MuJava and MuJava-M using classes of industrial-scale
projects. Our results indicate that MuJava-M generates
less mutants (on average 53.33% less) with 100% of effectiveness
in 19 out of 32 targets and more than 90% in 29 out of 32
mutation targets. MuJava-M also reduced the time to execute the
test suites against the mutants in 52.53% on average, considering
the full mutation analysis process.

RQ 1: *How many mutants are likely-subsumed?*



RQ 2: *How many mutants are incorrectly discarded from the minimal set?*

*Example 1*:

In the append method, we have the expression ``len + 8`` (Line 4).
This expression is used to define the length of an
array in a local variable. The minimal mutation set defined for
this target would be: ``ODL lexp`` (``len + 8 7→ len``), ``ODL rexp``
(``len + 8 7→ 8``), and ``AORB %`` (``len + 8 7→ len % 8``).
However, the minimal test set did not kill the
``AORB *`` (``len + 8 7→ len * 8``) mutation.
Initially, we thought that the mutant resulting from the
``AORB *`` mutation was equivalent, because it simply increases
the array storage space and, in principle, would not change
the behavior of the program. However, in Line 8 the newdata reference
is passed as a parameter to a parent class method that uses newdata
to change a byte array field.

```java
public void append(int inner, int outer, int name, int flags) {
    byte[] data = get();
    int len = data.length;
    byte[] newData = new byte[len + 8];
    for (int i = 2; i < len; ++i)
        newData[i] = data[i];

    int n = ByteArray.readU16bit(data, 0);
    ByteArray.write16bit(n + 1, newData, 0);

    ByteArray.write16bit(inner, newData, len);
    ByteArray.write16bit(outer, newData, len + 2);
    ByteArray.write16bit(name, newData, len + 4);
    ByteArray.write16bit(flags, newData, len + 6);

    set(newData);
}
```

*Example 2*:

At Line 11 of the xor method there is the following statement:
 ``result ^= element``. This statement applies an exclusive
disjunction logic operation among all elements of the array.
The minimal mutation set for this target is made up of
just one mutation: ``ASRS |=`` (``result ^= element 7→
result |= element``). However, the minimal test set did
not kill the ``ASRS &=`` (``result ^= element 7→ result
&= element``) mutation.

`Lindström and Márki`_ suggest that the subsumption
relations cannot hold when the mutated statements are re-executed
(in the context of strong mutation). If the mutated
instruction is executed more than once by any test execution,
we cannot determine the future state of the program. Since our
subsumption relations were obtained from a program where
the final state is known, they are not sufficient to represent
the mutation within a repeating context.

.. Lindström and Márki_: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/stvr.1667

.. code-block:: java
    public static boolean xor(final boolean... array) {
        if (array == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The Array must not be null");
        }
        if (array.length == 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Array is empty");
        }

        boolean result = false;
        for (final boolean element : array) {
            result ^= element;
        }

        return result;
    }


RQ 3: *What are the time savings of eliminating likely-subsumed mutants?*

```ruby
def foo(x)
  return 3
end
```
